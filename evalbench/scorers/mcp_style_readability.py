"""LLM-backed scorer that evaluates an MCP tool manifest against a style guide.

Follows the same shape as :class:`scorers.llmrater.LLMRater`: constructed with
``(config, global_models)`` and holds an LLM obtained via
``generators.models.get_generator``. The orchestrator calls :meth:`evaluate`
per endpoint with the tool man-page markup.

The model reviews the tools from an LLM-agent-consumption perspective and returns
a strict JSON object describing P0/P1/P2 findings, an overall readability score,
and any rules waived via the exceptions file. We parse and normalize that JSON
defensively so a slightly malformed response degrades to an ERROR row rather than
crashing the run.

PROMPT_TEMPLATE = (
    """You are an expert on MCP tool design and a pragmatic
API Developer Experience reviewer. Evaluate the MCP server's tool definitions
(shown below as a man page) against the STYLE GUIDE and report every violation.

Evaluate from the perspective of an LLM agent that must call these tools, and
judge every tool against the principle of designing APIs for easy LLM
consumption (understandable terminology, simple parameters, no client-side
logic):
- Will the model understand the terminology and the tool / parameter names?
- Are the parameters too complex, too numerous, or under-described?
- Is the agent forced to act like a computer -- e.g. formatting complex strings,
  generating UUIDs, calculating timestamps, or applying other client-side logic
  -- instead of simply expressing intent?
Adopt a consultative, pragmatic tone, like a human code reviewer (e.g.
"Consider if...", "Evaluate whether..."). Do not be overly pedantic about minor
wording or text issues when larger architectural blockers exist -- prioritize
the blockers. Only report issues that genuinely apply; do not fabricate issues
for a tool that has none.

Severity levels:
- P0: blocker -- critical violation (must fix; blocks compliance).
- P1: strong recommendation -- major violation (should fix).
- P2: informal suggestion -- minor / stylistic violation (nice to fix).

How to assign severity and rule_id:
- The STYLE GUIDE annotates each rule with its priority in an HTML comment next
  to the section heading, e.g. `### Tool Names <!-- priority: p1 ... -->` or
  `#### Safe Pagination <!-- priority: p0 -->`. Use that annotated priority as
  the severity of any violation of that rule (p0 -> P0, p1 -> P1, p2 -> P2).
- A heading may specify different priorities for different aspects, e.g.
  `<!-- priority: p1 for <action>_<resource>, p2 for snake_case -->`. Honor that
  split when classifying the specific violation.
- Use the section heading text as the `rule_id` (e.g. "Tool Names",
  "Use Human-Readable Time and Durations", "Concise Descriptions").
- Only report violations of rules that actually apply to the given tools. Rules
  about platform/registration/dashboards that cannot be judged from the tool
  schema alone should not be flagged as violations.

Avoid duplication (global vs per-tool):
- If an issue is global or repeats across many tools (e.g. a convention violated
  everywhere), report it ONCE with "tool" set to "" (empty string). Do NOT emit
  the same global issue once per tool.
- Report tool-specific issues with "tool" set to that tool's name.

### STYLE GUIDE
{style_guide}

### PRODUCT
{product_name}

### TOOLS (man page)

### EXCEPTIONS (waived rules — DO NOT count these as issues)
The following rules have been explicitly waived for this endpoint. Do not include
them in p0_issues/p1_issues/p2_issues or in "findings". Instead list them under
"waived" with their reason. If a waived rule would otherwise have been violated,
note that in the waived entry.
